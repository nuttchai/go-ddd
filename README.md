# go-ddd

To-do Lists:

- Create folder structure 
- Create sample code
- Create sample unit test

Question:

- Should we have multiple protocol, at least 2, like gRPC, GraphQL, REST?
  - Maybe GraphQL & gRPC
  - Or we work with REST first and then continue to work with two mentioned protocols above
